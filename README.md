# WhattsApp Clone Demo

This project is all about the design. With this project I try to make a similar UI and add some features of the popular messaging App *Whatsapp.*

Also I tried to develop some of the functionality from the application too (eg. audio recorder).

I used parse server for login and registration, but I had plans to port the login and registration to Firebase authentication and as online database.
