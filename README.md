# WhattsApp Clone Demo

This project is all about the design. With this project I try to make a similar UI and add some features of the popular messaging App *Whatsapp.*

Also I tried to develop some of the functionality from the application too.
I used parse server for login and registration, but I had plans to port the login and registration to Firebase authentication and as online database.

# Key features
* <p><b>Voice record and send</b>
* <p><b>Animations</b>
* <p><b>Camera feature</b>
* <p><b>Parse Server</b>
* <p><b>Database for Offline Caching</b>
  <br>
  <br>
